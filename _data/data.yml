    info:
      - role: Generation of Film Reviews
        time: 2019
        company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
        details: |
          Based on the NLP method, a GRU recurrent neural network is constructed,
          to train on reviews crawled from douban. Reviews can be generated based
          on film names and scores.
      - role: Auto-Control for Raspberry Pie Car
        time: 2019
        company: Undergraduate Innovation Program
        details: |
          Accomplish the control task of Raspberry Pie Car. Digital image processing
          methods as well as automatic control principleare applied for the Line 
          patrol and reversing tasks. 
      - role: Prediction of Metro Flow
        time: 2020
        company: Summer Camp in Tsinghua University
        details: |
          Based on the passenger flow records of Shenzhen Metro, noise data is 
          cleaned, machine learning methods and deep learning methods are applied 
          for training and flow prediction.
      - role: Video Object Tracking
        time: 2020
        company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
        details: |
          Based on the SiamFC fully convolutional network for object tracking. 
          Training on the ILSVRC15 dataset and good tracking results on traditional
          video tracking datasets such as VOT, ALOV, and OTB.
      - role: Research on Airway Segmentation
        time: 2021
        company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
        details: |
          To solve the broken end of the 3D airway segmentation results. A LSTM 
          module is inserted to the UNet structure to make full use of the continuity
          information of airways. Great improvements for the end detection.
      - role: Research on Airway Lumen Detection
        time: 2022
        company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
        details: |
          Lumen detection based on in-vivo and phantom images. YOLO-v3 is used
          as baseline network, a dual-input network CFDI is designed for domain
          feature extraction. Successfully improve detection results in images 
          with artifacts.
      - role: Research on Domain Generalization
        time: 2023
        company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
        details: |
          To improve the model for various dataset. Multi-center, multi-site 
          datasets are collected for training. Models are expected to perform
          well in dataset of unseen domain.

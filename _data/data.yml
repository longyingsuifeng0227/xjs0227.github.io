    info:
      - role: Generation of Film Reviews
        time: 2019
        company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
        details: |
          Based on the NLP method, a GRU recurrent neural network is constructed,
          to train on reviews crawled from douban. Reviews can be generated based
          on film names and scores.
      - role: Auto-Control for Raspberry Pie Car
        time: 2019
        company: Undergraduate Innovation Program
        details: |
          Accomplish the control task of Raspberry Pie Car. Digital image processing
          methods as well as automatic control principleare applied for the Line 
          patrol and reversing tasks. 
      - role: Prediction of Metro Flow
        time: 2020
        company: Summer Camp in Tsinghua University
        details: |
          Based on the passenger flow records of Shenzhen Metro, noise data is 
          cleaned, machine learning methods and deep learning methods are applied 
          for training and flow prediction.
      - role: Research on Airway Segmentation
        time: 2021
        company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
        details: |
          To solve the broken end of the 3D airway segmentation results. A LSTM 
          module is inserted to the UNet structure to make full use of the continuity
          information of airways. Great improvements for the end detection.
      - role: Research on Airway Lumen Detection
        time: 2022
        company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
        details: |
          Lumen detection based on in-vivo and phantom images. YOLO-v3 is used
          as baseline network, a dual-input network CFDI is designed for domain
          feature extraction. Successfully improve detection results in images 
          with artifacts.
      - role: Research on Domain Generalization
        time: 2023
        company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
        details: |
          To improve the model for various dataset. Multi-center, multi-site 
          datasets are collected for training. Models are expected to perform
          well in dataset of unseen domain.

      - role: Algorithm Intern
        time: 2023
        company: Meituan
        details: |
          (1)Video Portrait Segmentation: Mainly aimed at segmenting half body 
          portraits in short videos, using GAN networks for segmentation.The 
          discriminator provides a judgment on the segmentation quality based 
          on the segmentation results. 
          
          (2)Digital People: explore the field of AIGC, generate virtual 
          character images, and apply them to popular tasks such as 
          virtual live broadcast, digital population broadcast advertising, etc.
          Video-based Mouth Driver: Collect and process a large amount of data, 
          apply Wav2Lip network to adjust training, and achieve good results of replacing
          the month shape by target audios.
          Image-based Animation Generator: By applying techniques such as 3DMM model 
          coefficients and audio and video extraction, a single character image is created
          to drive the head movements and expressions of the character, and generate a digital human model.
